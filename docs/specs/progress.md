# Current Progress

This is the short status note for future sessions. Detailed history belongs in
`docs/specs/progress-history.md`.

## Current State

- The app foundation is implemented: Next.js shell, Supabase schema scripts,
  player/season/squad/match/formation management, period lineups, player match
  stats, dashboard, rankings, login screen, guest players, and deployment notes.
- Intended access mode is public read access with approved editing.
- Global login blocking is intentionally disabled in `src/proxy.ts`.
- Editors sign in at `/login`.
- `team_editors` is the editor allowlist.
- Vercel has been connected by the project owner.

## Security State

Security source of truth: `docs/security.md`.

The security cleanup is complete for the current owner workflow:

- `docs/database/supabase-rls.sql` was run or confirmed by the owner.
- `docs/database/supabase-security-cleanup.sql` was run by the owner.
- Public sign-up was handled in Supabase Auth.
- Owner has `can_manage_match_results = true`.
- Approved editor checks are present in write Server Actions.
- Match-result authority checks are present for score, completion, MOM, and
  player-stat writes.
- Birth date, contact, player memo, guest memo, and player-stat memo
  inputs/displays/writes have been removed from app code.
- Sensitive/free-text values were cleared to `null` through SQL cleanup.
- Logged-out write blocking was verified by the owner.
- Sensitive/memo fields disappearing from the deployed UI was verified by the
  owner.

## Verification

- `npm.cmd run lint` passed after the security cleanup code changes.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed after the security cleanup code changes.
- `git diff --check` passed; only line-ending warnings were reported.
- General editor behavior is not verified yet because real editor accounts will
  be added later.
- Mobile lineup dragging still needs real-phone verification.

## Next Actions

1. Start UI improvement planning in `docs/specs/ui/`.
2. Work with the owner through one-question-at-a-time planning and sketches
   before changing UI.
3. Keep mobile login/logout/account-state improvements in the UI backlog.
4. When normal editor accounts are added, verify:
   - normal editor can manage general records and lineups,
   - normal editor cannot write match results or player stats,
   - owner/result manager can write match results and player stats.
5. Verify mobile lineup dragging on a real phone browser.

## Remaining Risk

- Normal-editor behavior still needs verification once editor accounts exist.
- Mobile lineup drag has code-level support but still needs real-device
  verification.
- Mobile logout/account UI is not polished yet; it is not a current security
  blocker and should be handled during UI improvement work.
